Regulatory background
Asteroid Law:

US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (eff 2015) - 
- US-based companies own the minerals they have extracted  
- no regulation of space companies like Blue Origin, SpaceX until 2023

Luxembourg Asteroid Mining Law (eff 8/1/2018) - 
- Luxembourg-registered companies own the minerals they have extracted
- creates system for govt to authorize and supervise resource extraction in space

UN Outer Space Treaty - signed by US well shut my mouth
- nations cannot claim territory in space
- silent on whether companies can stake claims

The Hague International Space Resources Governance Working Group
- draft framework to resolve policy differences between nations


U.S. Regulation relating to ICOs:
[Legal Practitioners: Alice Townes, Sarah Hody]

Compliance considerations for ETHSF asteroid mining project:
(for links to authorities, see https://k-band.us/CryptoAgencies)

Crowdfunding 
	 - must register with SEC as a funding portal (or use registered broker-dealer)

Verifying minerals extracted    
	 - as securities administrator [need research], must register with SEC regardless of ICO 

Selling minerals extracted 
 	 - if sold as futures/swaps - must file reports with CFTC 

Distributing funds 
   	 - as money transmitter, must get licensed in all states where doing business
   	 - as MSB (money services business), subject to FinCEN criminal enforcement of securities laws 
   	 - FBI can assist with securities law violation enforcement

Trust policies 
 	 - advise users of income tax implications
	 - advise users of severance tax implications

Token sales/Crowdfunding rules:  [under construction]
SEC Reg D, Rule 506 - accredited investors, $50K minimum
SEC Reg D Rule 506(c)  - accredited investors, allows general solicitation
SEC Reg S - includes protection for overseas investors 
SEC Reg A+  - crowdfunding from the general public, requires prior SEC registration/review

Agency jurisdiction:

IRS Internal Revenue Service - tokens are property
     capital gains on user transactions, mining

SEC Securities & Exchange Commission - ICO tokens are securities 
     enforces Securities Acts, FCPA, Bank Secrecy Act (KYC/AML) - civil penalties
     exchanges, investment advisers, and administrators must register with SEC

CFTC Commodity Futures Trading Commission - tokens can be commodities
     regulates futures, swaps, commodity futures-linked securities
     certain persons must file ownership and control reports 

FinCEN Financial Crimes Enforcement Network - tokens are money
     regulates financial institutions, money services businesses - crypto exchanges are MSBs
     helps enforce BSA provisions of Securities Act - criminal penalties (=go to jail)

OFAC Office of Foreign Assets Control - trade sanctions and asset freezing  
     considering requiring financial institutions to screen individuals’ virtual currency addresses

State law - most states require licensing of money transmitters

General considerations:
For a very young business, the assurance of a conservative compliance approach should be balanced with the time- and money-sucking compliance costs that could sink the business. (See one founder’s experience, at 49:23-50:47.) One option is to follow financial industry best practices while very small, and then stay close to regulators as you grow. 

Possible ways to lower the risk of regulator attention early on: 
  - use language that conforms to the regulatory regime you want 
  - publicize internal trust policies to establish a reputation for integrity
  - make communications about what you do and who you serve bland and generic, describing services
     in factual terms that avoid loaded words
also consider when liability insurance makes sense, and probably publish an age recommendation.

_________________________________________________
Questions/challenges:
1.  Do we need to do basic KYC and link tokens to real person name, address, tax number? 
    
    For ICOs/crowdfunding - YES, per Bank Secrecy Act as enforced by SEC and FinCEN
 
    Info required for compliance not specified in FinCEN rules [need research] 
    you must get info on beneficial owner, not just legal owner
    use FINRA as model? - FINRA rule is tautological 
    --> try minimum id information but swath in lots of good intention language in all public and private communications
 
2. For token transferability, is it possible in legal prose to refer to “token bearer” generally, 
   not specific physical person/entity?
   
   For tokens on centralized or semi-decentralized exchange - probably not, because FinCEN claims crypto exchanges are MSBs       so must file SARs and Currency Transaction Reports (they have begun to look at at decentralized exchanges too 
    as conduits for dark money)
 
3. Can we use existing solutions connecting Ethereum smart contract and legal prose? 
	
     Look at private supply chain projects for model of mining-to-market tracking
     Look at NFT token licensing, like Cryptokitties for digital assets
 

Astero smart legal agreement
     - store hash or checksum of traditional contract in smart contract 
     - traditional contract held where?
     - KYC compliance - reference self-sovereign identity token (ex: Civic, Sovrin) 
       or authorization tokens (ex: SelfKey) for accredited investors
     - compliance for secondary trades (1-year lockup for Rule 506c securities) 
        reference other legal compliance projects
 
Provide model contract/licensing agreement with national government? 
     - get exclusive right to explore/mine the discovered resources in exchange for royalties, taxes, and/or other 	 
       obligations, unless government already has law governing mineral rights in space, then wow 
     - the property law in space is even more undeveloped than crypto law, so this will not insure that your country 
       will or can enforcement your mining claims
		
Taras’s smart legal agreement
     - link offline dumb contract for real-world proceeds with digital smart contract distributing proceeds 
     - enforce operator to transfer mined materials to agent nominated by tokenholders, or 
       to sell at market price and distribute proceeds to agent
     - commodities can be identified/verified through sensors, IOT, scanners, system feeds, by community, consortium, DAO etc
     - physical assets are regulated by the jurisdiction you’re in - smart contract depends on dumb contract enforced by 
       jurisdiction the defendant is in
 
Options we considered for contract for proceeds distribution:
property ownership 
- not real property - under existing law, companies only own minerals after they are extracted
- personal property - commodities are fungible so it would be an agreement for a measure of the commodity or the $ proceeds

joint venture - structurally ok for profit/loss sharing - but may be issue of control over the venture  
- CA law: “It is not sufficient that the parties have certain plans in common, but the community of interest 
  must be such that  [each] is entitled to be heard in the control [of the enterprise].” 
- See JV scenario: 
  https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3814426/Gcamines-to-restructure-mining-contracts-with-JV-partners-chairman.html

futures contract (CFTC-regulated) 
- standardized, tradeable agreement to buy or deliver for sale a commodity...
- think it has to be for certain amount of the commodity [need research - regular contracts do not need to be for certain 
  amount]   

equity ownership share  
- used by startup teams that are legal entities (corporations can have tradeable ownership shares) or DAOs  
- tokenholders are shareholders, tokenholders vote on what to do with them or sell the ore and pay out dividends etc
