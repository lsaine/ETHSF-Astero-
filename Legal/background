Regulatory background
Asteroid Law:

UN Outer Space Treaty - signed by US well shut my mouth
- nations/companies cannot claim/own territory in space
US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (eff 2015) - 
- US-based companies own the minerals they have extracted  [how affect foreign corporations?]
- no regulation of space companies like Blue Origin, SpaceX until 2023
Luxembourg Asteroid Mining Law (eff 8/1/2018) - 
- Luxembourg-registered companies own the minerals they have extracted
- creates system for govt to authorize and supervise resource extraction in space

U.S. Regulation relating to ICOs:
Legal Practitioners: Alice Townes (Townes Law), Sarah Hody (Perkins Coie)

Compliance considerations for ETHSF asteroid mining project: 
Crowdfunding 
- must register with SEC as a funding portal (or use registered broker-dealer)
Verifying minerals extracted    
- as securities administrator [need research], must register with SEC regardless of ICO 
Selling minerals extracted 
 	 - if sold as futures/swaps - must file reports with CFTC 
Distributing funds 
   	 - as money transmitter, must get licensed in all states where doing business
   	 - as MSB, subject to FinCEN criminal enforcement of securities laws 
   	 - FBI can also assist with securities law violation enforcement
Trust policies 
 	 - advise users of income tax implications
	 - advise users of severance tax implications

Token sales/Crowdfunding rules:  [under construction]
SEC Reg D, Rule 506 - accredited investors, $50K minimum
SEC Reg D Rule 506(c)  - accredited investors, allows general solicitation
SEC Reg S - includes protection for overseas investors 
SEC Reg A+  - crowdfunding from the general public, requires prior SEC registration/review

Agency jurisdiction:
IRS Internal Revenue Service - tokens are property
capital gains on user transactions, mining

SEC Securities & Exchange Commission - ICO tokens are securities 
enforces Securities Acts, FCPA, Bank Secrecy Act (KYC/AML) - civil penalties
exchanges, investment advisers, and administrators must register with SEC

CFTC Commodity Futures Trading Commission - tokens can be commodities
regulates futures, swaps, commodity futures-linked securities
certain persons must file ownership and control reports 

FinCEN Financial Crimes Enforcement Network - tokens are money
regulates fin. institutions, money services businesses(MSBs) - crypto exchanges are MSBs
helps enforce BSA provisions of Securities Act - criminal penalties (=go to jail)

OFAC Office of Foreign Assets Control - trade sanctions and asset freezing  
considering requiring financial institutions to screen individuals’ virtual currency addresses

State law - most states require licensing of money transmitters

General considerations:
For a very young business, the assurance of a conservative compliance approach should be balanced with the time- and money-sucking compliance costs that could sink the business. (See one founder’s experience, at 49:23-50:47.) One option is to follow financial industry best practices while very small, and then stay close to regulators as you grow. 

Possible ways to lower the risk of regulator attention early on: 
  - use language that conforms to the regulatory regime you want 
  - publicize internal trust policies to establish a reputation for integrity
  - make communications about what you do and who you serve bland and generic, describing services
     in factual terms that avoid loaded words.
also consider when liability insurance makes sense, and probably publish an age recommendation.

Questions / challenges:
1.  Do we need to do basic ‘KYC’ and link tokens to real person name, address, tax number? 
For ICOs/crowdfunding - YES, per Bank Secrecy Act as enforced by SEC and FinCEN
 
info required for compliance not specified in FinCEN rules 
note: you must get info on beneficial owner, not just legal owner
use FINRA as model? - haha FINRA rule is tautological 
--> try minimum id information but swath in lots of good intention language in all public and private communications
 
2. For token transferability, is it possible in legal prose to refer to “token bearer” generally, not specific physical person/entity?
For tokens on centralized or semi-decentralized exchange - probably not, because FinCEN claims crypto exchanges are MSBs (must file SARs and Currency Transaction Reports) 
 
3. Can we use existing solutions connecting Ethereum smart contracts and legal prose? 
	
Look at private supply chain projects
OpenLaw - smart contracts - “model all or parts of legal agreements using code”
Chainlink - links only to already-digitized assets
NFT token licensing, like Cryptokitties - for digital assets
 
*Astero smart legal agreement 
- store hash or checksum of traditional contract in smart contract 
	- traditional contract held where?
- KYC compliance - reference self-sovereign identity token (ex: Civic, Sovrin) 
  or authorization tokens (ex: SelfKey) for accredited investors
	- compliance for secondary trades (1-year lockup for Rule 506c securities) 
    reference other compliance projects (ex: Harbor? Tokensoft?)
 
Provide model contract/licensing agreement with national government? 
giving exclusive right to explore/mine the discovered resources in exchange for royalties, taxes, and other obligations--unless government already has law governing mineral rights in space, then wow
		
Taras’s smart legal agreement
- link offline dumb contract for real-world proceeds with digital smart contract to distribute
- enforce operator to transfer mined materials to agent nominated by tokenholders, or to sell   
  at market price and distribute proceeds to agent
(commodities can be identified/verified through sensors, IOT, scanners, system feeds,
by community, consortium, DAO etc)
- physical assets are regulated by the jurisdiction you’re in - smart contract depends on     
  dumb contract enforcement by jurisdiction the defendant is in
 
Options we considered for contract for proceeds distribution
property ownership 
- not real property - companies only own minerals after they are extracted
- personal property - commodities are fungible so it’s an agreement for a measure of the 
  commodity itself or the $ proceeds 
joint venture - structurally ok for profit/loss sharing - but may be issue of control over the venture  
CA law: “It is not sufficient that the parties have certain plans in common, but the community of interest must be such that [each] is entitled to be heard in the control [of the enterprise].” also how would it work with many entities?
futures contract (CFTC-regulated) - think it has to be for certain amount of the commodity 
[need research - regular contracts do not need to be for certain amount]
standardized, tradeable agreement to buy or deliver for sale a commodity...
equity ownership share  
used by startup teams that are legal entities (corporations can have tradeable ownership shares) or DAOs - tokenholders are shareholders, tokenholders vote on what to do with them or sell the ore and pay out dividends etc
